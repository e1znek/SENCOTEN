3D printing files for SENĆOŦEN language


Cookie Cutter:
Defualt they are 10mm in height but I found making them 15 may create better shapes with the playdough. 
This should be a fairly easy edit, either with modeling software or printing software by increasing height.

SVG:
SVG files for each letter 

cura plans:
letters with joins are built using a raft for easier removal than a brim.
letters without joins are printed using a PVA brim for easy removal.
raftVowelsX4.3mf creats 4 copies of joned vowels for a cura buildplate.
raftconstanants.3mf is a cura file that has 1 set of constanants for a cura buildplate.
the numbered files are the 3 files layed out for the non joined. Settings are 0.2 layer height, no supports needed, PVA brim (3-5mm width), 10% infill.
The frequency is as followed: 4 of E, A, Á, S, I, ,Í , Ⱥ, Ś, Ṯ,  N, L and 2 of every other letter.

blocks:
blocks are defaulted to a height of 60mm but the prefered printing size is 37.5mm. Use uniformed scaling to shrink it to the appropriate size.
PVA supports prevent sag and easy post processing.

stl letters:
letters made from SVG files.
see join information for instructions on how to align letters with joins.
